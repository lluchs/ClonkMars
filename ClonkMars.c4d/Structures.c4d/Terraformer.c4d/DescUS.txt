The Terraforming unit produces heat and lets rain fall. 

As an effect of that, plants will grow, which produce within a certain radius oxygen on the surface of the planet. 

Using LEDs, plants will even grow under the earth ("dig" shows where plants might grow).

"Throw" (de)activates terraforming
"Up" shows the radius in which plants will grow
"Dig" shows where the terraformer will remove earth or ash rain. These can be reset using the context menu.
